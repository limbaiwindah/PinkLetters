# 🎀 Pinkletters

## Description
**Pinkletters** is a personal mini project designed to send future letters to friends using PHP. The emails can be triggered manually via the terminal or automatically using a cron job (still a work in progress).

This was built with simplicity and sentimental value in mind — a digital time capsule of sorts.

## Tools Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- PHP  
- MySQL (for database storage)  
- XAMPP (local development environment)

## Features
- 📬 Send future letters via SMTP  
- ⏰ Scheduled sending using cron jobs (in progress)  
- ⚙️ Composer autoloading for clean PHP structure

## How to Run
To manually trigger the sending script, run:

```bash
php send-letter.php
```

## Installation
Tested locally using XAMPP. No complex setup required — just clone and run.

> 💡 Make sure your SMTP credentials are properly set in mailer.php or your config file.

## Developer Note
This was intentionally kept small and personal, but if you'd like to use it to send your own letters to someone, feel free to clone it or visit the website (). 🎀
